## ⭐ Fun Fact

I recently learned that 30–50% of people don’t have an inner voice. Some think in images, others in sounds, and some think without a voice or visuals at all. As someone who overthinks and thinks visually, this blew my mind — and reminded me how differently people experience the world. It also influences how I approach web development: what feels intuitive to one person may not be to another, which is why thoughtful, inclusive design matters.
